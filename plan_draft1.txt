Steps:
1. MLS.com, find the stats I want

2. Find schedule that I can use to create urls for mls.com.
	Only have a schedule going back to 2013

3. Find players salaries. 
	Only have data going back to 2013
	
4. Create a player db
	Mostly focused on how much each player was worth. Key identifier for player_no
	Include goals, assists, interceptions, yellows, reds, wins, losses, draws, clean sheats if appropriate,position,
	Extras: traded, played half season,

5. Create a game db
	Would like Chris's thoughts on this.
	It makes sense to only have one record per game. Still, if I want to grab all POR games, how do I query that?
	Columns: home, away, home goals, away goals, stadium, ref, weather, time, h-yellows/reds, a-yellows/reds, ot, playoffs, attendance reported
	Key identifier, game_no =
						home_team_no-away_team_no-date(yyyy-mm-dd)    ---- Better idea
						game number of season - date
	
6. Create a team db
	Organized by POR, TOR, LAFC, etc. Key Identifier
	Goals Scored, Goals against, Opp, home/away, players, subs(1,2,3), sub time, cards, game of season, elimination, game_no_year, 
	Goal Minutes(as vector)
	
7. Goals DB
	game_no, scored, scored on, scorer, goalie, minute, go ahead goal, to draw goal, brace, hat-trick,
	
8. Cards Table
	Mirror the goals table
	game_no, player_no, minute, first, second, red, players left,
